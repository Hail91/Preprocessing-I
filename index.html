          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <p>I've spent about 3 months learning JavaScript, and I've come to realize I've only
							really scratched the surface of what is possible with JavaScript. I plan on devoting
							a lot of time into really getting comfortable with it, and implementing it into all 
							my projects going forward.</p>

            <h2>CSS3</h2>
             <p> I've been working with CSS3 for about 3 months now. Working with CSS has been
                a humbling experience as CSS seems to always have a few tricks up it's sleeve!
                But it's a truly powerful tool in the web development world, and I truly enjoy
                working with it.</p>

  <p>My name is Aaron Gillies, I'm 28 years old and an aspiring software/web developer. I currently attend Lambda School
    for their Full Stack Web Development program. Prior to this, all my experience has been in the retail sales and merchandising

    career path for it!
